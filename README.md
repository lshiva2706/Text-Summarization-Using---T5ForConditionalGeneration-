# Text-Summarization-Using---T5ForConditionalGeneration-

Overview
Text Summarization Using T5ForConditionalGeneration is a project that demonstrates the application of the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model for text summarization tasks. This project aims to provide a straightforward and efficient way to generate abstractive summaries of text documents.

Features
T5 Model: Utilizes the T5 model, a versatile transformer-based model, for text summarization. The T5 model can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including summarization.

Abstractive Summaries: Generates abstractive summaries that capture the main ideas and key points of input text. This goes beyond simple extractive summarization by creating human-like summaries.

Customizable: The project is designed to be customizable, allowing users to fine-tune the T5 model on their own datasets or specific summarization tasks.
